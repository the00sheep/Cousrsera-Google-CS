A virtual private network, also known as a #VPN, is a network security service that changes your public IP address and hides your virtual location so that you can keep your data private when you're using a public network like the internet.

VPNs also encrypt your data as it travels across the internet to preserve confidentiality. A VPN service performs encapsulation on your data in transit. #Encapsulation is a process performed by a VPN service that protects your data by wrapping sensitive data in other data packets.

You could secure a data packet by encrypting it to make sure your information can't be deciphered, but then network routers won't be able to read the #IP and #MAC address to know where to send it to. This means you won't be able to connect to the internet site or the service that you want. #Encapsulation solves this problem while still maintaining your privacy. VPN services encrypt your data packets and encapsulate them in other data packets that the routers can read. This allows your network requests to reach their destination, but still encrypts your personal data so it's unreadable while in transit. A VPN also uses an encrypted #tunnel between your device and the VPN server. The encryption is ==unhackable== without a #cryptographic-key, so no one can access your data.
