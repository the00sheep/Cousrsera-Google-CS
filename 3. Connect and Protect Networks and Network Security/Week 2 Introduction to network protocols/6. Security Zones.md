Security zones are a segment of a network that protects the internal network from the internet. They are a part of a security technique called network #segmentation that divides the network into segments. Each network segment has its own access permissions and security rules. Security zones control who can access different segments of a network. Security zones act as a barrier to internal networks, maintain privacy within corporate groups, and prevent issues from spreading to the whole network.

Additionally, an organization's network can be divided into #subnetworks, or subnets, to maintain privacy for each department in a organization. For instance, at a university, there may be a faculty subnet and a separate students subnet. If there is contamination on the student's subnet, network administrators can isolate it and keep the rest of the network free from contamination.

An organization's network is classified into two types of security zones. 
First, there's the ==uncontrolled zone==, which is any network outside of the organization's control, like the internet. Then, there's the ==controlled zone==, which is a subnet that protects the internal network from the uncontrolled zone. There are several types of networks within the controlled zone. 

==The DMZ contains public-facing services that can access the internet.==
On the outer layer is the demilitarized zone, or #DMZ, which contains public-facing services that can access the internet. This includes web servers, proxy servers that host websites for the public, and DNS servers that provide IP addresses for internet users. It also includes email and file servers that handle external communications. The DMZ acts as a network perimeter to the internal network. 

==The DMZ, internal network, and restricted zones are all within the controlled zone. The internal network contains private servers and data that the organization needs to protect.==
The #internal-network contains private servers and data that the organization needs to protect. Inside the internal network is another zone called the restricted zone.

==The DMZ, internal network, and restricted zones are all within the controlled zone. The restricted zone protects highly confidential information that is only accessible to employees with certain privileges.==
The #restricted-zone protects highly confidential information that is only accessible to employees with certain privileges.
