An incident response playbook is a guide that helps security professionals mitigate issues with a heightened sense of ==urgency==, while ==maintaining accuracy==. Playbooks ==create structure, ensure compliance, and outline processes for communication and documentation==. 

Note that playbooks are ==living documents==, meaning the security team will make ==frequent changes, updates, and improvements== to address new threats and vulnerabilities. In addition, organizations learn from past security incidents to improve their security posture, refine policies and procedures, and reduce the likelihood and impact of future incidents. Then, they update their playbooks accordingly.

As an entry-level security analyst, you may be required to use playbooks frequently, especially when monitoring networks and responding to incidents. Having an understanding of why playbooks are important and how they can help you achieve your working objectives will help ensure your success within this field.
