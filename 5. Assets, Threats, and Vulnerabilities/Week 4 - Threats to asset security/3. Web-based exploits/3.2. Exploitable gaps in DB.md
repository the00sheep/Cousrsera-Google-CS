A **SQL injection** is an attack that executes unexpected queries on a database. Like cross-site scripting, SQL injection occurs due to a **lack of sanitized input**. The injections take place in the area of the website that are designed to accept user input. 

A common example is the login form to access a site. One of these forms might trigger a backend SQL statement like this when a user enters their credentials. Web forms, like this one, are designed to copy user input into the statement exactly as they're written. The statement then sends a request to the server, which runs the query. Websites that are vulnerable to SQL injection insert the user's input exactly as it's entered before running the code.

Malicious hackers can target these attack vectors to obtain sensitive information, modify tables and even gain administrative rights to the database.

The best way to defend against SQL injection is code that will sanitize the input. Developers can write code to search for specific SQL characters. This gives the server a clearer idea of what inputs to expect. One way this is done is with prepared statements.

A **prepared statement** is a coding technique that executes SQL statements before passing them on to the database. When the user's input is unknown, the best practice is to use these prepared statements. With just a few extra lines of code, a prepared statement executes the code before passing it on to the server. This means the code can be validated before performing the query.
