Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks. Malware, which is short for malicious software, can be spread in many ways. For example, it can be spread through an infected USB drive. Or also commonly spread between computers online.

Devices and systems that are connected to the internet are especially vulnerable to infection. When a device becomes infected, malware interferes with its normal operations. Attackers use malware to take control of the infected system without the user's knowledge or permission. Malware has been a threat to people and organizations for a long time. Attackers have created many different strains of malware. They all vary in how they're spread.

Five of the most common types of malware are a virus, worm, trojan, ransomware, and spyware.

A **virus** is malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. Viruses typically hide inside of trusted applications. When the infected program is launched, the virus clones itself and spreads to other files on the device. An important characteristic of viruses is that they have to be activated by the user to start the infection.

A **worm** is malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. While viruses require users to perform an action like opening a file to duplicate, worms use an infected device as a host. They scan the connected network for other devices. Worms then infect everything on the network without requiring an action to trigger the spread.

Viruses and worms are delivered through phishing emails and other methods before they infect a device. Making sure you click links only from trusted sources is one way to avoid these types of infection. However, attackers have designed another form of malware that can get past this precaution.

A **trojan**, or Trojan horse, is malware that looks like a legitimate file or program. The name is a reference to an ancient Greek legend that's set in the city of Troy. In Troy, a group of soldiers hid inside a giant wooden horse that was presented as a gift to their enemies. It was accepted and brought inside the city walls. Later that evening, the soldiers inside of the horse climbed out and attacked the city. Like this ancient tale, attackers design trojans to appear harmless. This type of malware is typically disguised as files or useful applications to trick their target into installing them.

Attackers often use trojans to gain access and install another kind of malware called ransomware. **Ransomware** is a type of malicious attack where attackers encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. These kind of attacks have become very common these days. A unique feature of ransomware attacks is that they make themselves known to their targets. Without doing this, they couldn't collect the money they demand. Normally, they decrypt the hidden data as soon as the sum of money is paid. Unfortunately, there's no guarantee they won't return to demand more.

**Spyware** is malware that's used to gather and sell information without consent. Consent is a keyword in this case.

Organizations also collect information about their customers, like their browsing habits and purchase history. However, they always give their customers the ability to opt out. Cybercriminals, on the other hand, use spyware to steal information. They use spyware attacks to collect data like login credentials, account PINs, and other types of sensitive information for their own personal gain.
