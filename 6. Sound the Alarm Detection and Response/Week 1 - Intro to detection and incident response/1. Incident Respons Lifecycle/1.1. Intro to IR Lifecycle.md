The five core functions of the NIST CSF are: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. 

This course will explore the last three steps of this framework: detect, respond, and recover. These last three steps are critical stages during incident response, and as an analyst, you'll detect and respond to incidents and implement actions for recovery.

The NIST incident response lifecycle is another NIST framework with additional substeps dedicated to incident response. It begins with preparation. Next, detection and analysis, and then containment, eradication and recovery, and finally post-incident activity. One thing to note is that the incident lifecycle isn't a linear process. It's a cycle, which means that steps can overlap as new discoveries are made.

According to NIST, an incident is "an occurrence that actually or imminently jeopardizes, without lawful authority, the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or an information system; or constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of law, security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies." 

It's important to understand that all security incidents are events, but not all events are security incidents.

An event is an observable occurrence on a network, system, or device.

Here's an example of an event. A user attempts to log into their email account, but they can't because they forgot their password. The user then requests a password reset and successfully changes their password.

This is an **observable event**. Why? Because systems and applications **log** password reset requests and logs provide evidence that something happened. We know that someone successfully requested a password reset and that they did not violate security policies to access the account.

Now, imagine that instead of the rightful owner of the account, a malicious actor trying to gain access to the account, successfully initiated the password change request and changed the account password. This would be considered both an event and a security incident. It's an event because it's an observable occurrence. It's also a security incident because a malicious actor violated the security policy to unlawfully access an account that is not rightfully theirs.

Just like detectives working a case carefully handle and document their evidence and findings, security analysts are required to do the same when they investigate a security incident. An incident investigation reveals critical information about **the five W's** of an incident: who triggered the incident, what happened, when the incident took place, where the incident took place, and why the incident occurred.

As an analyst, you'll need a method to document and reference this information for easy access when you need it. A great way to do this is to use an incident handler's journal, which is a form of documentation used in incident response.
